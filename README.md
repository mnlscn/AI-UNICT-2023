# AI@UNICT 2023 - Object Detection with Faster R-CNN and Backbone Models

For this object detection project, I opted for the powerful Faster R-CNN model, a cutting-edge deep convolutional neural network introduced by Ren et al. in 2016. This state-of-the-art architecture represents a significant leap forward in object detection compared to earlier methods like R-CNN and Fast R-CNN. What sets Faster R-CNN apart is its ability to construct a region proposal network, which generates region proposals that are subsequently fed into the detection model (Faster R-CNN) for precise object evaluation.

In addition to Faster R-CNN, I harnessed the potential of several backbone models, essentially serving as feature extractors for the object recognition model. The primary objective is to evaluate their performance and ascertain which backbone model yields the most impressive results. The carefully selected backbone models for this study include:

- **ResNet50 FPN**: A Residual Network with 50 layers, enhanced with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for improved feature extraction.
  
- **ResNet50 FPN v2**: A refined version of ResNet50 FPN, offering enhanced feature extraction capabilities.
  
- **MobileNet**: Known for its efficiency, MobileNet provides an intriguing alternative as a backbone model.

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the performance of these backbone models and their impact on object detection accuracy, contributing to the ever-evolving field of computer vision.
